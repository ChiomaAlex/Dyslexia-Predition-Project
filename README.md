I developed an ensemble stack model, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Tree classifiers, using a dyslexia dataset with 3,644 records. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used to select the most relevant features and improve the model's performance. This method accurately reflects intricate data patterns for more precise predictions.
The ensemble stack model achieved outstanding performance, as evidenced by a 97.83% accuracy rate, a 91.43% precision level, a 91.50% recall rate, and an F1-score of 92.02%. The model's ability to accurately identify dyslexic individuals, while maintaining a balance between precision and recall, is emphasized by these metrics.
